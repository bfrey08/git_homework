Two take aways that I have had since starting Mod 0. Firstly, success is going to be highly influenced by my environment. Utilizing POM breaks to help me not go down a rabbit hole as well as collaborating with coworkers to remain socially stimulated. Secondly, success is going to be much greater if I do not take shortcuts. I need to spend time learning new habits like strictly using keyboard controls. I feel like a fish out of water with them currently, however, in time these will prove to be much more efficient.

Two new strategies I am committed to trying during the rest of Mod0. First is scheduling my time via the Calendar. The second is utilizing POM breaks during my own work.
Shoutout to Sam D! I'm currently working next to him and we've been able to bounce ideas/concepts against each other.

Shoutout to Delilah N. for being a great session 3 breakout room partner!
