Two take aways that I have had since starting Mod 0. Firstly, success is going to be highly influenced by my environment. Utilizing POM breaks to help me not go down a rabbit hole as well as collaborating with coworkers to remain socially stimulated. Secondly, success is going to be much greater if I do not take shortcuts. I need to spend time learning new habits like strictly using keyboard controls. I feel like a fish out of water with them currently, however, in time these will prove to be much more efficient.
